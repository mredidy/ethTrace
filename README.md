# ethTrace 💡

**ethTrace** is a public REST API that enables real-time and historical analysis of Ethereum transaction flows based on geolocation, block height, token transfers, and contract activity. Built for developers, analysts, and researchers, ethTrace turns blockchain noise into actionable insights. 🚀📊🌍

ethTrace delivers a suite of endpoints powered by: 🛠️🔍🌍

- Public Etherscan API
- Google Cloud's Blockchain BigQuery datasets
- Lightweight geo-tagging and wallet tagging techniques

All wrapped in a blazing-fast FastAPI backend. ⚡🦄🚀
